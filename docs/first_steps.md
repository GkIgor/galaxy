## Welcome to galaxy lang docs

If you, like me, were tired of always doing the same thing, not learning anything new, or simply wanted to try out a new language, you've come to the right place. 

### What is the Galaxy language? ðŸŒŒ
Galaxy is a simple programming language, with a lean and friendly syntax. It was designed to be easy to understand and use, but at the same time powerful enough for more complex tasks. The syntax for "Hello World" in Galaxy, for example, is super elegant:

```galaxy
package main

import (
"std"
)

def main () -> void:
    std.printf("Hello world")

```
Simple and straight to the point! ðŸ˜Ž
