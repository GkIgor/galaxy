## Contributing

🎉👍Hello dev, thank you for thinking about contributing to our project, your help is very important to us. 👍 🎉 

To facilitate your contribution, I am writing this guide. Because I keep in mind that help from the community is essential for the growth of a project, and contributing here is very simple, just follow this guide and send the pull request.

### Guide and commits

To contribute, start by forking the repository, then you can start working on the code, here in this repository we use a commit convention, if you don't know what this is, read this guide: <a href="https://www. conventionalcommits.org/pt-br/v1.0.0-beta.4/"> conventional commits</a>, We use this convention to facilitate code maintenance, as we can make mistakes in our codes, it's okay, we are human and can make mistakes, and commits are a history of our changes or contributions. Using this convention we can navigate between the commits and we will be able to find where we added the code that possibly caused an error in the application, so that we can edit the code and fix it or even recover the state before the commit. Right after you finish doing everything, it is very important that you make sure you have finished everything before making the pull request. If you have, make the pull request and briefly explain your changes. What did you do, why did you do it, how did you do it, to facilitate code review. 

### Unit Testing

Another thing we check before accepting the pull request is whether the new code you added has unit tests for it, we emphasize the importance of always adding unit tests for new features, to ensure that everything is working as expected, so No new bugs are introduced or anything like that.
