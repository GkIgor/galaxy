### Goals
Our main idea is to use a usable language with a clean, easy-to-learn syntax, in addition to the possibilities of native libraries that can expand your project without the need for additional frameworks or packages that make your project too large. We know that several languages ​​have a huge learning curve, and with that in mind we think it is possible to create something simple, but that allows you to create professional projects.

### Can I help with the project?

All possible help, whether monetary even pennies or with development, dissemination or even giving **new tips**, will be received with open arms and we will be eternally grateful for that. It is not possible to create a large project with goals without the help of other people involved.
